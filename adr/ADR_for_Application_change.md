# Choice of changing the application

# Status: accepted

# Context:

We made the decision to change our banking application to a technical support application which consists of features such as a customer manager, product manager, and technician manager.

# Decision:

The application was changed because we had issues with the database connecting to the web server using our current code. We are able to successfully implement the technical support application using Docker.


# Consequences:

By switching applications, we are having an easier time building the application and using a better file structure.
