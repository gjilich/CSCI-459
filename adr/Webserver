# Choice of webserver

# Status: accepted

# Context:

Apache, an open source HTTP server software is our webserver of choice. It will be the host for our application and process requests as necessary.

# Decision:

Apache is free to use and the current leading webserver software. Official Apache containers are available in the Docker Hub which will allow for reliable web connectivity for our application.


# Consequences:

Minimal effort is required to deploy a functional webserver for our application.
