# Choice For Application Plug-in Style

# Status: accpeted

# Context: 
	
For our project, we have decided to make a way to create different plug-ins 
for managing products, technicians, and customers for our web application.

# Decision: 
	
By creating these different plug-ins, we will be able to easily manage different
ways that we can add CRUD functions to our applications by adding and removing
whatever plug-ins are needed, instead of having to redundantly go back and forth 
through the code. 

# Consequences: 

There's minimal effort required to update our application due to us being able 
to swiftly add and remove different plug-ins to adjust our application based
on customer needs.
