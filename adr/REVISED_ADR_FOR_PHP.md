#Choice of language

#Status: accepted

#Context:
PHP will be used to as a means to develop and implement a customer manager for a tech support site.

#Decision:
PHP is the chosen language due to its widespread usage and ease of implementation. PHP has convenient
and effective features to work with our webserver and database. In addition, the entire project team
has relative experience with the language.

We considered the idea of using the more popular Node.js, which would of been a better alternative
to PHP, but due to a lack of experience with the application, we opted to stick with PHP for
convenience.PHP itself doesn't require as much code as Node.js and using Node.js requires more
of a understanding on callback functions and blockings in order to code with it. The devolpment
environment is also a lot easier to configure.

#Consequences:
Little to no learning curve is required for us to use the language and collaborate.
