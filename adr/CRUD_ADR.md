# Choice of Structure Components 

# Status: accepted

# Context:

CRUD functions allow us to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE resources within our web application.

# Decision:

CRUD allows us to be able to store first Name, email, phone, and passwords for our customers information and properly manage it without any major issues. With the use of CRUD, we avoid Data Redundancy and Update Anomalies allowing our web application to run smoothly and store data efficiently. 


# Consequences:

Minimal effort is required integrate CRUD Structural Components to our web application. If integrated the wrong way, there can be Data Redundancy which later creates a probably when querying the Data.
