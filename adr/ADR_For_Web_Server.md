# Choice of web server

# Status: accepted

# Context: 
	
Apache, an open source HTTP server software is our web server of choice. 
It will be the host for our application and process requests as necessary. 

# Decision: 
	
Apache is free to use and the current leading web server software. Official Apache 
containers are available in the Docker Hub which will allow for reliable web 
connectivity for our application.

# Consequences: 

Minimal effort is required to deploy a functional web server for our application.
