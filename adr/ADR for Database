# Choice of database

#Status: accepted

#Context:

MySQL is an open source relational database management system. We'll be using this as our database for managing 
the customers. 

#Decision: 

MySQL is the chosen database application we've decided to use due to how simple it is to structure and add
data for a database system. Our team also has much experience with MySQL.


#Consequences:

Little effort needed to update the database system
