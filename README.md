##

Container volumes are not working correctly.

To get the project to run you must currently run on localhost through Xampp by
dropping the project folder (Called:ch06_tech_support Located:php-apache folder) into the htdocs folder of the xampp directory (usually placed in your main drive) and then access the localhost with localhost/ch06_tech_support
If you have netbeans and xampp you can run the intial index file from it.
